For this challenge, we are introducing a new instruction `MUL`. This works in the same way as the `ADD` instruction works. In other words, it multuplies the contents of the Accumulator with the value is stored at the location you reference.

You will need to create a `DAT` memory variable before you use the `MUL` instruction. You can call it anything you like.
