Counters are something you will need to fully understand no matter what programming language you are using.

Take a look at the code on the left hand side. The problem it is trying to solve here is ...

> Calculate N factorial (N x N-1 x N-2 ... 1)
>
> more formally written as $$ n!=\prod_{k=1}^n k \! $$

The code on the left does this for you using a loop and a counter.
