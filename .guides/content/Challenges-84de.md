On the following pages you will find a series of challenges. They start off nice and easy and then progressively harder.

## Testing
On each of the challenge pages you will see a 'Check It!!' button. These will be complete before the end of June 2015. In the meantime you will see a temporary message.

When Codio releases its Teacher Support functionality, where teachers can monitor student progress, then results of these tests will feed through automatically into the Teacher Dashboard.

## More challenges to come
We will be adding a set of intermediate and advanced Crunch challenges which we will add to the Crunch course.
