On the left is a sample Crunch program. Feel free to play around with it. It does the following

- Asks for a number
- Outputs the 'Times Table' for that number from 1 to 12

## Run mode
Rather than stepping through, you can also let the program run at full speed by pressing the Run button in the button panel on the right of Crunch.

You can do this directly from edit mode or when already stepping (explained below) through the code.

## Debug / Step mode
One of the really nice features of Crunch is the ability to step through the code at your own speed to see how the code is executing line by line.

- Press the Step button and it will start to execute the code. 
- You can continue to press Step to execute each instruction in turn. 
- Inspect the `DAT` memory locations to see how they change during the lifetime of the program.
- Press Stop at any time to return to edit mode.


## Edit Mode
You can edit your code from the main edit screen. If you see a Stop button enabled, then press it to return to edit mode.

It will be useful to watch the overview video on the previous page to see how to create and edit a Crunch program.
