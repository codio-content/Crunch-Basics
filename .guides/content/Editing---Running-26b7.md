On the left is a sample Crunch program. Feel free to play around with it. Try pressing the Run or Step buttons. This program 

- asks for a number
- outputs the 'Times Table' for that number from 1 to 12

## Debug / Step mode
One of the really nice features of Crunch is the ability to execute your code one line at a time. You click a button each time you want Crunch to execute the next line so you can see exactly how your code runs. 

- Press the Step button and it will start to execute the code. 
- You can continue to press Step to execute each instruction in turn. 
- Inspect the `DAT` memory locations to see how they change during the lifetime of the program.
- Press Stop at any time to return to edit mode.

## Run mode
Rather than stepping through, you can also let the program run at full speed by pressing the Run button in the button panel on the right of Crunch.

You can do this directly from edit mode or when already stepping through the code.

## Edit Mode
You can edit your code from the main edit screen. If you see a Stop button enabled, then press it to return to edit mode.

It will be useful to watch the overview video on the previous page to see how to create and edit a Crunch program.
