## Thanks to Little Man Computer
Crunch is a modern, full-featured alternative to Little Man Computer, for teaching assembler. 

It is testament to Little Man Computer that it is still being used many years later. We have taken inspiration from it and given it a modern feel and a more complete instruction set that allows you to focus on thinking about your algorithm rather than having to learn the syntax. 

## Suggestions
If you have any suggestions on how to improve Crunch or would like to suggest additional challenges, please email them to support@codio.com and we'll see what we can do.
