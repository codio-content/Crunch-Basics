This is a good point to give you a simplified introduction to how the CPU works and how it is connected to the computer's RAM memory.

This is not intended to teach you the detailed ins and outs of the *fetch-execute* cycle, but it will help you understand very well the way a computer thinks and works.

## Illustrating with Crunch
Perhaps the best introduction to this is to use Crunch itself. And rather than asking you to read lots of detailed information, a video is our best teacher here.

Before we look at the video, let's consider the simple problem we are solving. Let's take a really simple bit of pseudo-code.

```
X = 10
Y = X * 2
```

So, we would expect Y to be 20. 

Now watch the video to see how a CPU would run this program.

## Step through the code
On the left is the same Crunch program we showed in the video.

Press the Step button to start executing the code line by line. Press the Step button again each time you want to execute the highlighted line and follow what is going on.

You can press the Stop button at any time to terminate execution.
