The thought processes we have been exploring are a bit of a brain cruncher. If you are new to computing then this is likely to hurt a little.

So, now is the time to examine the code and setp through it.

## Change X
You should change the value of X to different values and then step through the code again.

As we are comparing to `20`, try different value above, below `20` as well as `20` itself.

## Change BGT
You can also change the `BGT` instruction to one of the other branch operators, like `BEQ`, `BLT` and so on.
